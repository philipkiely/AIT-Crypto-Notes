In symmetric key encryption, the encryption and decryption keys are both private, you need to establish a shared secret. With public key encryption, the keys are different, so it is asymmetric key encryption. The encryption key is public, the decryption key is privately generated, so there is no need to securely establish a shared secret.

There is a 3 order of magnitude difference of speed between AES and RSA. AES is 1000 times faster as it is symmetric key.

The idea of digital envelope allows for higher performance encryption using public key. Encrypt the main message using AES on a random key, then encrypt the key using the receiver’s public key.

Prime factorization of large ((1024 || 2048 || 4098)-bit) composite integers is a hard problem that RSA is based on. The discrete log problem is another hard problem that can be used for asymmetric key encryption with thousands-bit numbers.

Semantic security is the idea that given two plaintexts and one cyphertext that is the encryption of one of the plaintext, you have no way of determining which plaintext it corresponds other than guessing. Basically, you can’t extract any meaningful information from the cyphertext. Block cyphers have this property.

With public key cyphers, you use the public key for encryptions. Thus, given a small number of plaintexts, you can decrypt by brute force by encrypting each plaintext and checking which matches. Public key cyphers by default do not provide semantic key security so they are not appropriate if there is a small plaintext space. We solve this by making the encryptions probabilistic, that is, mixing a random factor to the plaintext. Textbook RSA is not a semantically secure system, it is deterministic.

PKCS \#1 is “Public Key Cryptographic Standard” and it defines how to properly salt a message for RSA (sprinkle on a bunch of randomness)

RSA uses three algorithms: encryption, decryption, and key-pair generation. 

Key-pair generation:

* Generate two primes (guess and check)
* Multiply them together to generate the compund integer modulus, n, which is public and a part of the public key
* The other part of the public key is the exponent, e, which is 1 \< e \< phi(n), phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1).
* The encryption takes the plaintext m, representing it as a number, and raising it to e, then mod by n
* the private key exponent is d, cyphertext is c
* ​encryption `m^e mod n = c`
* ​decryption `c^d mod n = m`​

If m and e are small, it is possible that m^e is less than n, in which case c = m^e, which is easy to reverse by the e-th root.

A very common ‘e’ is e = 2^16 + 1\. It is nice for performance as the speed of the computation relies on the number of 1s in the binary representation of the exponent, and this e only has 2 1s in the binary representation (then, decryption is 100 times slower as d is mostly 1s). However, the same e requires that everyone has different ns. Using the chineese remainder theorem, it can be possible to find a common m^e with this common exponent, allowing easy discovery of plaintext. 

RSA has a homomorphic property, it is malleable. You can send it to a third party who can modify it without reading it. If you have two cyphertexts c1 and c2, you can obtain a valid cyphertext c3 by multiplying them together. Say we have a cyphertext c = m^e mod n and an oracle where we can send any cyphertext except c and get a plaintext. Compute c \* r^e, where r is a random number, and send it to the oracle which will decrypt, as it is not c, so the oracle will send you back m\*r, then divide by r to get m. PKCS protects against this in practice as well.

ElGamel is another public key method with the same three algorithms. The public key is from a large prime p, the generator element g, which generates a public finite set. The private key is a random number x. The public key is k = g^x mod p. No one can compute x from k. Given k, take m and generate a random y (probabilistic), and compute g^xy mod p. Then, the receiver gets g^y mod p. Then they can calculate g^xy and decrypt the message.

Elliptic curve cryptography is the same set of operations but in a different finite group. This group is a set of points from a discrete elliptic curve, added using a defined method. Then we can implement the same type of encryption but by adding points instead of repeated multiplication. It allows us to achieve higher levels of security with faster operations on smaller keys, faster than any other public key method except RSA with specific exponents chosen for speed.
